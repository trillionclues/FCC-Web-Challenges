# FCC-Web-Challenges

<h2>The FCC-Web-Challenges are a compilation of all the tasks and challenges from FreeCodeCamp towards mastery of Responsive Web Design</h2>

Today I passed the Survery Form (but for the NYSC program, a one year scheme for University graduates here in Nigeria which I'm curently a participant) challenge using HTML and CSS.

<h2>What I learned</h2>

1. Creation and styling of HTML forms.

2. Texboxes, dropdowns submit buttons, checkboxes markups and more.

3. Creating overlays and using the Z-index.

Here's a live link to view the form:
